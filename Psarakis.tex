I am in the master's program studying cybersecurity. I am currently in the process of a career transition; my previous job was as a Russian and French linguist. I am planning on graduating in May 2021, with the main goal of combining the skills I am getting now in this program in cybersecurity with the foreign languages I know.

In terms of research, I spent the summer doing the first three credits of my master's thesis, and I am looking to complete and defend it during this Fall semester. I am investigating the vulnerabilities of internet voting, comparing different implementations, and testing the code in one open-source implementation to see if it is in fact secure in terms of the security properties it claims to ensure.

To tell you a bit more about my background, I've lived in many different countries, mainly in Western Europe. I've had the opportunity to travel to Africa and Central Asia. I was also a "human test subject" at NASA, and tested exercise equipment that is now on the International Space Station.

Outside of my career pursuits, I am passionate about animal rescue, and have been a volunteer at the Humane Society for nearly five years.

\textbf{Question (from Cassandra Putman):} You went from learning different human languages to learning different programming languages.  Which one do you find more challenging to learn?
\textbf{Answer to Cassandra Putman from Maria Psarakis:} Thanks for your question! I think I would have to say programming languages, mainly because I haven't had as much practice. That may be the key to both, is just lots of practice.

\textbf{Question from Duane Michael:} Hi Maria, it sounds like you've had a fascinating life! It sounds like what you have in mind for a career transition is very interesting. I find cyber threat intelligence particularly interesting, which is what I thought of when I read the first line of your bio. Do you plan on pursuing that type of work? If not, what type of security work are you interested in and how will you use your foreign language skillset?
