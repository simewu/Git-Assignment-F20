Jordan: FYI, you need permissions for the project before you can do a "push". Hope that helps.

How do you update the .pdf file? -Cassandra


Folks! I tried to use CLI to only push my three edited files but it replaced the entire repository with my files. I had a backup of entire repository from half an hour earlier, I returned all your files with most recent edits as there were before. There was no edit for the files during that time; therefore, all the edits are remained as uploaded by other students. I sincerely appologize for any inconvinence. Best, -Maximus  
Maximus- I tried to make an update to my file and it gave me a bunch of errors about unrelated merge files.  So... I may have hosed some things.  Hoping someone knows how to fix it, because this is my first github experience so I intend only to break things (unintentionally) and learn as I go. (googling got me to where we are now, so I'll refrain from doing that anymore for the time being until I hear from someone who has a clue).  --Cassandra

Cassandra -- The latest change last nigh should have all the edits by everyone and my changes were only added in three files: Mofidi.tex, Peng.tex, and Scott.tex. In the first one I added my answer and in the next two, I added two questions. All other files were remained unchanged and I upload them again. I also have an entire backup of files before I edit my three edited inside a zip folder (before I push my three files and then had t replace to files again). Please let me know if you beed that. I also see my edits are gone. -Maximus

Guys -- Consider removing classes from your .tex file. If you compile it locally you will see why in your Assignment3.pdf; because classes are already added. it probably returns error for others who may want to push it. Compare other .tex files aagainst yours. I already reverted back all other aux files I uploaded last night using CLI with exactly the same version they had before. -Maximus
