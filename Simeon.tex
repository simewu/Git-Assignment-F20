\subsection{Goals for the Course}
Hello, I am Simeon. I enrolled in CS 6000 with the intention to improve my research habits and make them better suit my degree. I hope to learn more about how to use \LaTeX and other research tools, so that I can put my work into words and create something publishable. Figure~\ref{fig:simeon} is a picture of me.

I am working on my PhD in Cybersecurity with Dr. Chang, and have been working with him since my undergrad years, which included researching and applying my knowledge to his research projects. Throughout my time working with him, I have built a few big cryptocurrency simulations and got my feet into the water of the official Ethereum and Bitcoin source code.
