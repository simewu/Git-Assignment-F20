\subsection{My Background and Goals for CS 6000}
My names are Ijeoma Olawale and I go by IJ. I am in my second semester and third class as a PhD student in Security in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I have an exciting career for over 12 years in GRC, IT Risk management, IT Security Audit and Compliance working in the financial industry, government and consulting services. For CS 6000 class, I hope to learn about the research methods and publishing tools in Computer Science and how to effectively read, write and present research papers. With this knowledge gained, I hope to be able to develop my thesis proposal and write an acceptable thesis and research papers.
\subsection{My Research Interests}
My research interest is in the security of IoT and wearables; understanding the threats and attack surfaces that connected things like cars and healthcare gadgets face. As a security risk professional, I am concerned about the security and privacy issues that are prevalent with connected devices. These lack of security and privacy principles presents the potential for data integrity abuse, access control, authentication, authorization and non-repudiation issues. I hope that with the knowledge gained from CS 6000 I would be able to write a paper that can significantly contribute to the body of knowledge.
\subsection{My Personal Interests}
To spice up my life, I love taking road trips, going to the movies and attending live Christian concerts. I also love to volunteer because I believe that it is my little way of giving back and a chance to ‘pay it forward’. I volunteer as a Sunday school teacher at Crossroads Community Church, Parker CO and as a support crew with Winter Shelter Networks, Douglas county. I have volunteered as a DBA for Colorado Association of Black Professional Engineers and Scientists (CABPES) and I am exploring the opportunities to mentor and encourage middle and high school girls to take on careers in computer science and information security.


\textbf{Question from Abiola Ogundeko}
Have you been able to identify novel problem areas in your area of research interest that would be impactful to research community? I am more than willing to work with you once you have a problem area that you think is worthy of contribution.
\end{textbf}
\textbf{Answer to Abiola Ogundeko:}
Novel problems!!! hahahaha I am still taking baby steps and learning how to read the research papers and do survey on the papers related to my research interests. So far, I am trying to identify gaps in the existing technologies and tools for special needs people and trying to figure out if there are potential areas for me to research on. As for novel...I will let the reviewers that review my papers to decide... Thanks Abiola.
